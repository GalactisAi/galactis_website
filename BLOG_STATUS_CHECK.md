# ✅ Blog Status Check - Quick Guide

## 🎯 Two Separate Issues

### 1. ✅ Hydration Error (FIXED)
- **What it was**: React warning about `data-cursor-element-id` attributes
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to root layout
- **Impact on blog**: None - this was a React warning, not a blog functionality issue

### 2. ⚠️ Placeholder Blogs (Separate Issue)
- **What it is**: Blog shows 3 placeholder posts instead of real Hygraph posts
- **Status**: Depends on your configuration
- **How to check**: Visit `/api/blog-diagnostic` or check server logs

---

## 🔍 How to Verify Blog is Working

### Step 1: Check Diagnostic Endpoint
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/blog-diagnostic`

**Good signs:**
- ✅ `hygraphConfigured: true`
- ✅ `tokenConfigured: true` (optional but recommended)
- ✅ `postsCount: 1` or more
- ✅ No errors in `testResults`

**Bad signs:**
- ❌ `hygraphConfigured: false` → Need to set `HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT`
- ❌ `postsCount: 0` → No published posts in Hygraph
- ❌ `error` in testResults → Check error message

### Step 2: Check Server Logs
When you visit `/resources/blog`, look for:

**✅ Working:**
```
✅ Successfully fetched 1 posts from Hygraph
📝 Post titles: example
```

**⚠️ Not Working:**
```
⚠️ Hygraph endpoint not configured
⚠️ Using fallback placeholder posts
```

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Look for any errors
- Check Network tab for failed API calls

---

## ✅ Your Current Setup

Based on your configuration:

1. **Environment Variables**: ✅ Set in `.env.local`
   - `HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT` ✅
   - `HYGRAPH_TOKEN` ✅

2. **Hygraph API**: ✅ Working (tested successfully)
   - Returns 1 post: "example"

3. **Blog Page**: Should show real posts if:
   - Environment variables are loaded
   - Dev server was restarted after adding env vars
   - Posts are published in Hygraph

---

## 🚨 Why You Might Still See Placeholders

### Reason 1: Dev Server Not Restarted
**Fix:**
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Reason 2: Posts Not Published
**Fix:**
1. Go to Hygraph Studio
2. Open your post
3. Click "Publish" (green button)

### Reason 3: Environment Variables Not Loaded
**Fix:**
1. Verify `.env.local` exists in project root
2. Verify values are correct
3. Restart dev server

### Reason 4: GraphQL Schema Mismatch
**Fix:**
1. Check `/api/blog-diagnostic` for schema errors
2. Verify Post model fields match queries in `lib/hygraph.ts`
