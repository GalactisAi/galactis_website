# 🔧 Hydration Mismatch Fix

## Problem
React hydration error caused by `data-cursor-element-id` attributes that are added client-side but not present during server-side rendering.

## Root Cause
These attributes are likely added by:
- Framer Motion library (for animation tracking)
- Browser extensions
- Development tools

## Solution Applied
Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to root HTML and body elements in `app/layout.tsx`. This suppresses hydration warnings for attributes that don't match between server and client.

## Why This is Safe
- These `data-*` attributes are non-functional (they don't affect page behavior)
- They're added after initial render for tracking/development purposes
- Suppressing the warning doesn't affect React's ability to hydrate the component tree
- The actual content and functionality remain intact

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)
If you want a more targeted fix:

1. **Identify the source**: Check browser console to see if a specific library or extension is adding these
2. **Component-level suppression**: Add `suppressHydrationWarning` only to specific components that need it
3. **Disable the feature**: If it's from Framer Motion, you can configure it to not add these attributes

## Verification
After this fix, the hydration error should no longer appear in the console. The page will function normally.
