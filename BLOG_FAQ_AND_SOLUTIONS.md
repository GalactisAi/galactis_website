# 📚 Blog FAQ: Fake Posts & SEO Benefits

## ❓ Why is the blog showing "fake" placeholder posts instead of Hygraph posts?

### Root Causes

The blog page shows 3 placeholder posts when it cannot fetch real posts from Hygraph. This happens when:

1. **Environment Variable Not Set**
   - `HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT` is missing from `.env.local` or production environment
   - **Fix**: Add `HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://ap-south-1.cdn.hygraph.com/content/cmioez7bb01n507walq7vz2vr/master`

2. **No Published Posts in Hygraph**
   - You have posts in Hygraph but they're in "Draft" stage, not "Published"
   - **Fix**: In Hygraph Studio, click the "Published" button (green) for each post

3. **GraphQL Schema Mismatch**
   - The query fields don't match your Hygraph Post model
   - Common issue: Query uses `publishedDate` but schema has `publishedAt`
   - **Fix**: Check your Post model fields in Hygraph Schema and update queries in `lib/hygraph.ts`

4. **Network/API Error**
   - Hygraph API is down or endpoint URL is incorrect
   - **Fix**: Test the endpoint directly or check Hygraph status

### How to Diagnose

#### Method 1: Check Server Logs
When you visit `/resources/blog`, check your terminal/console for:
- ✅ `Successfully fetched X posts from Hygraph` → Working!
- ⚠️ `No posts from Hygraph` → See error messages below
- ⚠️ `Using fallback placeholder posts` → Fix the issue above

#### Method 2: Use Diagnostic Endpoint
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/blog-diagnostic` (or `https://galactis.ai/api/blog-diagnostic`)

This will show:
- Whether `HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT` is configured
- How many posts are found
- Any GraphQL errors
- Specific recommendations

#### Method 3: Test GraphQL Query Directly
```bash
curl -X POST "https://ap-south-1.cdn.hygraph.com/content/cmioez7bb01n507walq7vz2vr/master" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ posts(stage: PUBLISHED) { id title slug excerpt publishedDate } }"}'
```

If this returns an error about `publishedDate`, your schema uses `publishedAt` instead.

### Quick Fixes

**If you see placeholder posts:**

1. **Check Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   # In .env.local
   HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://ap-south-1.cdn.hygraph.com/content/cmioez7bb01n507walq7vz2vr/master
   ```
   Then restart: `npm run dev`

2. **Publish Posts in Hygraph**
   - Go to https://studio-ap-south-1.hygraph.com
   - Open your post
   - Click "Publish" (green button in top right)

3. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

4. **Check Field Names**
   - In Hygraph Studio → Schema → Post model
   - Verify field names match queries in `lib/hygraph.ts`
   - Common mismatch: `publishedAt` vs `publishedDate`
